Hey guys! I'm going to be home alone tomorrow, for about 12 hours. This is very rare for me, and I definitely want to take advantage of the situation, within reason, of course. Any suggestions?

First step is to start hydrating now. Get yourself fully hydrated so you won't have to work hard to fill up when you want to play.

What do you like doing? Holding and getting desperate? Or wetting? Or both?

I enjoy both equally. I am quite desperate right now haha, I took your advice on hydrating

Unfortunately, not much to say. My bladder is pretty much made of steel, and although I had drank over 7 bottles of water I was only nearing a 5 or 6 when my roommates got home and the three of us went out.
