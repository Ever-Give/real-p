Need to pee so badly, and looking for some creative ideas that will be a little fun, but won't wake the fam up in the middle of the night here

I made the mistake of a few glasses of water before bed and now my bladder is so so deliciously full and I'm just squeezing my legs together and rocking a bit-feels good, but not as good as letting go in a huge, hot gush will feel!!

Just can't decide how and where, besides the toilet obviously, and not the shower either(looking for something a little different)..and in bed is out too as my hubby is sleeping there lol.

Must be quiet, and not involve too much clean up lol, and please hurry, I'm throbbing I need to go so badly already....

Oh, oops that probably would have been better, maybe it can be moved....

Loving the ideas, and still holding....I'm so so full and will have to do something to fix that as soon as I get out of bed. Some how I managed to fall back asleep for a bit but now I'm very awake and very aware of just how badly I need release. My bladder is aching and my panties feel just a little damp, maybe I leaked a tiny bit in my sleep...or maybe I'm just so aroused by how so agonizingly good this feels.....

Wet and hot, but I guess I this thread reeeeaaaalllllly doesn't belong here now, cuz it all ended up in a cute little diaper.....

Maybe next time it'll be a real wetting lol
