Apparently I can’t get enough of being wet this weekend.....

I had been drinking tons of water today, therefore peeing like crazy.....would be a shame if I didn’t get soaked at some point!

I usually love rubbing and squeezing and grabbing when I’m desperate, but this time I thought I’d challenge myself to hold perfectly still for 10 second blocks.....standing right in front of the toilet, it was harder than I thought....the first 10 seconds I almost made it through, but right at the end a slow leak started spreading and spreading.....I took 10 seconds to squirm and press, then tried to hold still for 10 more.....impossible to hold it....but so so so very fun, and of course, very warm and wet.....mmm
