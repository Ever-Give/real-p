About to go for groceries....gonna test a tena pad out.....

I peed when I woke up, had coffee and a water since...one of my favorite grocery store activities is going padded and letting out a little leak in each aisle.....there’s about 10 aisles....usually I wear goodnites, but with leggings, the tena are so discreet.....gonna try them out

Mmmmmm looking forward to groceries for a change.....ill post back when I’m done, so that this actually turns into a Wetting ‘experience’ lol......

Mmmmmm thay was super fun.....there were way more than 10 aisles....but the tena did great, I guess the trick is definitely little leaks.....at each aisle I would let just a little out, only enough to feel the warm wetness, then stop....it got harder and harder as I went along, mostly because it felt so very good and naughty....I may possibly have quietly moaned a few times lol.....good thing it wasn’t busy!

I even felt dry enough to leak at all the red lights on the way home.....so so warm and wet....mmmmmmmmm

Plus, I’m still wearing it! Filling up in coffee and wAtervwhike I put the groceries away.....leaking every now and then....
