This morning, half an hour ago, I woke up quite desperate (as it often happens). I was still half asleep, and stayed in my bed for a little time. Actually, a little too longer, since suddenly I felt a spurt of pee coming out and then my boxers were wet. I ran to the bathroom without any other accident and took that photo back in my bed.
