The long, desperate walk home

It was a long time ago. We had attended an academic conference, my girlfriend and I. We worked at different universities, but were in the same field and lived together in the same city, so we traveled in the same circles and to the same events. The days were long - hours and hours of specialized training and research presentations and mingling sessions with academics from throughout North America. This particular conference was in Canada, in a city that shall remain unnamed to protect our identities because our field can get a bit narrow. The location of the conferences normally wouldn't be pertinent to a story like this, except the fact that it was in Canada was critically important to engineering this situation that would be a joy for me and torture for my girlfriend.

One night, we met up with some friends and headed to a bar to catch up after the daily conference activities had ended. It was hours of eating, drinking, having fun. But eventually, the night had run its course, and it was time to head our separate ways. We said goodbye to our friends, who immediately left. I mentioned to my girlfriend that I needed the restroom before we left. She said, "I have to go too, but last time I went to the women's room there was a bit of a line. Do you think I should go now, or just wait until we get back to the hotel?" 

Now, this question was not at all innocent. As far as I could tell this line could not have been that bad - there was nobody waiting outside the door, and she had come back to our table within minutes last time she had used the bathroom. But she knew what I enjoyed perfectly well, and this was her excuse to give me the choice of whether she should empty her bladder now and be comfortable, or hold it in to the hotel so she could tease me with her full bladder on the walk home. I chose the latter. "It's up to you, but the walk isn't too bad, so if you aren't too desperate maybe you should just wait for the hotel." She laughed and gave me a cheeky smile, then waved me off to the men's room, where I happily relieved myself so I would be comfortable to enjoy her predicament.

We had booked a cheaper hotel room about 20 minutes walk from the conference to save money. So we took off, heads full of booze that clouded our judgment, in a direction we thought was the hotel. Turned out, we took a wrong turn somewhere. We ended up in an unfamiliar residential neighborhood. We tried turning back, but ended up even more lost. This was in the early days of smart phones, so I had some crappy LG that was halfway between a dumb phone and a smart phone, and she had an early iPhone model. We tried to pull out her iPhone and see if we could use it for navigation, but it turned out that neither of us had a data plan that would work in Canada! We couldn't use our phones to navigate to the hotel without a working data plan, so we were completely lost.

We wandered aimlessly, half-drunk, for the next half hour or so. We had found our way to an empty residential neighborhood and there was nobody else walking around. My girlfriend became progressively more and more preoccupied with her bladder. She kept updating me on how bad it was getting. Whether it was so I could enjoy the situation or because she couldn't think of anything else, I couldn't say. First, "I should have peed before we left the bar." Then, "It's getting really bad. I need a bathroom soon!" Then, "I have to pee so bad I feel pregnant." Finally, "It's getting really difficult to hold it in."

We continued walking. She was alternating between speedwalking and waddling. "I need a bathroom now but I can't walk too fast, it hurts too bad." And it kept going that way for a while, her with her awkward walk telling me how bad she had to go and me trying not to get too turned on by it. It must have been about an hour of aimless walking since we left the bar, and my girlfriend was starting to look miserable, her face with a look of hard concentration. 

"If we don't find the hotel soon, I'm going to need to find a bush or something." She grimaced at me. I didn't know what to say back. I was turned on, but she knew it, that didn't need to be mentioned aloud. There weren't actually any bushes she could get behind, because we were right in the heart of the city, so nothing I could help with there. I felt sympathetic and maybe should have offered some words of comfort, but my brain was too focused on her desperate predicament to come up with the right words of comfort. So I remained silent.

Until, by total chance, we broke through the residential neighborhood into a commercial one. All the shops that might have had customer bathrooms were closed, but she came across her savior: a casino. Outside the casino, there was a shuttle bus with a crowd trying to board it. Falling in behind the crowd, I put one foot up onto the steps of the shuttle and asked the driver if we could get a ride. "Depends on the destination. We drop guests off if they're staying at one of the nearby partner hotels." I decided not to let on that we weren't casino patrons; instead, I asked, "Can you drop us off at X Hotel?"

"Absolutely!" I then asked if we had a moment for my girlfriend to go into the casino to use the restroom before he left. He politely responded, "Sorry, I wish I could, but I have to operate on a schedule or I'll get in trouble. There will be another shuttle in half an hour though." I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to take the shuttle or use the bathroom. She bit her lower lip and gave me an anxious look, thought for a few seconds, and said, "I don't want to wait half an hour for another shuttle this late." So we got on.

We were the third or fourth stop, which meant about ten more minutes of waiting for my poor desperate girlfriend. She was bouncing in her seat, fanning her legs, and at one point even put a hand up her dress to push on her crotch a bit. There is absolutely no way she would have put on such a show if she were sober, and it was driving me wild. I felt bad for her, but I was struggling to contain my excitement, and she knew it and (as she later admitted) was intentionally playing it up a bit to try to turn me on even more as a distraction from her bladder. I rested a hand on her bouncing knee at one point, enjoying how she had to keep her leg moving in order to prevent herself from leaking.

Finally, we were in front of our hotel. She was in the window seat, and pushed me out into the aisle so she could scramble off the shuttle. I quickly handed the shuttle driver a toonie on the way out, and we walked through the sliding doors into the hotel. There were restrooms right there in the lobby, but I didn't mention them to her, and she either didn't notice or decided not to use them for my benefit. She speed walked over to the elevator, with me close behind. She pressed the call button, waited a minute, gave up before the elevator even arrived. "I can't do this, let's take the stairs," she said, pulling me by the arm over to the stairs. We climbed up to the second floor where our hotel room was, walked down the hall, her gently holding her hands on her abdomen as if to cradle her bladder through her dress. Finally, we were at our hotel door. She looked expectantly at me, and I took the key card out of my wallet and slid it in and out of the lock.

The light showed red. The door was still locked. I tried again. Red again. She made a loud groaning sound. I couldn't help but laugh a little at this final obstacle. She whined, "it's not funny!" But she was laughing a bit too, enjoying that I was enjoying her desperation.

Finally, on the third try, the light went green. The lock clicked open. "Thank Christ!" she gasped, pushing her way past me as I opened the door. I closed the door behind us, as she kicked off her flats and was pulling off her underwear at the entrance to the bathroom. As she was pulling her dress up on her way to the toilet, she turned to face me, holding her dress above her stomach, and said, "Look at this! I have to go so bad you can see my bladder!" And I could, in fact, see her bladder. Not too large, mind you, but her usually fairly flat abdomen was distended with a small bump that was clearly the outline of an exceptionally full bladder that was bursting to be emptied from a long night's worth of pent up booze.

As she backed up to the toilet, I hugged her, preventing her from sitting down. We kissed, deeply, for a moment. I grabbed her back, started to unzip her dress, then pulled back for a moment. At this point she was looking pretty turned on too, so I decided to push my luck. "Before you go, may I...?" I asked, motioning toward her abdomen. She knew what I wanted, and nodded yes. She pulled her dress off completely so that she was naked except for her bra and socks. Then she grabbed my left hand and guided it gently to her pubis, and slowly brushed it upward until it rested gently over that beautiful round lump. Feeling emboldened by her willingness to go along with me, I dug my fingers in a little, feeling that tense, overfilled organ. She grimaced and laughed, slapping my hand away. "Not so hard, you're going to make me leak!" She allowed me to place my hand back gently again. "I'm going to need to go soon though, I can't hold it in much longer," she told me.

But I was feeling bold. "Do you think we could... well... you know?" She seemed to pause for a moment, then responded, "I think so, but not for very long, and me on top. I don't want you to put any weight on my bladder." I agreed to these terms, quickly pulled off my clothes and pulled out a condom from my suitcase. By the time I was lying on my back in bed, she was completely naked as well, and kneeled over me.

She started to ease down, and moaned as my penis entered her. I could feel the pressure from her bladder through her vaginal wall, squeezing my penis, creating resistance as she lowered herself down on me to let me enter all the way. It felt like it was trying to squeeze me back out of her. "This feels so intense," she told me. "It made me have to go even worse but it feels kind of nice." Then she began to raise and lower herself, slowly, delicately, so as not to disturb her bladder, again and again. The sensation was so overwhelming, and the situation was such a big turn on, that even though she was going slow I could not last long - perhaps a couple minutes. As hard as I tried to hold back to prolong this glorious round of fun my girlfriend had generously granted me, I quickly finished into the condom. As she saw my face and felt me pulse inside her, she said, "That was great but I really have to go now. I feel like I'm a balloon that's about to pop."

She raised herself off of me and hobbled back over to the bathroom. I followed and watched as she quickly pulled up the lid and threw herself down onto the seat. A waterfall tumbled out of her and into the toilet bowl, thundering loudly for perhaps 25 seconds before it stopped. She stayed seated for a few more minutes, waiting for a few last spurts to dribble out of her before she would relinquish her throne. As she sat there, I thanked her for indulging me, and she told me that she had enjoyed it too. "But let's not let it get that filled next time. It can't be healthy!" She was right of course, but it would make a nice memory for both of us for years to come.

After that, she came over to the bed, where it was my turn to take care of her this time. I made sure to reward her for all the fun that she had given me.

Wow. This story was really arousing. It was long and well detailed Thank you for sharing it.

It reminds me of my girlfriend then wife back when we were young. After an evening drinking at a club and not using the restroom she would tell me how desperate to pee she was. Same as you this got me excited and she gave to my requests for her to hold it while we had sex. She enjoyed sex on a full bladder but was not into pee play. I asked her how she was feeling and she would respond like it is going to come out, but it also feels too good to stop. She didn't care if she wet the bed once we got going. Only once did she lose a strong spurt right on ly penis.

I like details, and filled them in as best I could remember them! It's been long enough at this point that some of the smaller details like exactly what my girlfriend said, the specific order things happened, how long we spent doing certain things, and so on have gotten a little jumbled, so it may be that I got some minor things wrong. But for the most part I remember the incident clearly because it was so enjoyable, and it felt better for storytelling to just tell things as they are in my mind now instead of delving into minor specifics of where my memory may have failed me.

My girlfriend says a full bladder squishes everything together in a way that makes sex more intense and heightens the feeling. She prefers the comfort of sex in an empty bladder, but the intensity of a full bladder is novel for her and she also enjoys that it turns me on. She has leaked in bed but only VERY rarely and never very much.

When you mentioned that she said "But let's not let it get that filled next time. It can't be healthy." and "I have to pee so bad I feel pregnant." I wonder a couple things. Was this the worst she's ever had to pee, like her worst pee emergency that she's ever experienced with her bladder being extremely full to the point that it's really painful? If she did say things like that, then she probably was in extreme pain from needing to pee with such a distended bladder. As much as I felt sorry for her for feeling that amount of pain from holding back so much piss, it's still pretty hot that you both had full bladder sex despite her feeling like she'll explode and its even more hot that she enjoyed it. She must love feeling her bladder this full when she has the bedroom fun with you. Thank you for posting this story, I really enjoyed it.

It was not the absolute worst she has ever had to pee, no, although it ranks up there among the particularly interesting incidents she recounts for me on occasion. By her own account, the worst she has ever had to pee as an adult "depends on how you measure it", and is basically a tie between waiting in a long customs without using the bathroom first (even though she never came close to an accident, her bladder got so full and she held on so long that she ended up with lingering soreness and intermittent painful muscle spasms for the next few hours after she relieved herself).

And a time in college when she very nearly wet herself after a four-hour freshman orientation because she drank a bunch of coffee and didn't make it to the front of the bathroom line during a break between sessions then had to wait in line again at the end of the second session (she told me that hearing other people peeing and washing their hands nearly caused her to leak before she was able to get a stall to herself, and that she couldn't make too big of a scene while trying to hold it in because these were her future classmates, so it was sheer force of will that prevented her from having an accident). She has squatted for an emergency pee a couple times, but as far as I remember only when emboldened by alcohol, and she also has unintentionally leaked into her underwear on a few rare occasions, but these incidents were due to temporary incontinence rather than true severity of need.

As for her enjoyment of full bladder sex, I would say that she much prefers an empty bladder because it lets her focus on her own pleasure more instead of trying to hold it in, but yes the fact that it results in a more intense experience for her and mixes with sexual pleasure in her mind definitely turns me on. She is also turned on by me being turned on by her situation, so it ultimately benefits us both that she does this for me sometimes. In general, I would not want her to hold past the point where she feels safe, and on the rare occasions when she has to go as badly as she did during this story, I usually don't even suggest she hold it in any longer, much less ask her to have penetrative sex with me. I think we were both feeling frisky and bold that night because of the booze and the fun of being away from home.

Yeah. This is understandable. As much as I fantasize about a young woman holding a very full bladder during sex and seeing her do a major piss in front of me among some of the other fantasies that I have, I know that holding it in too long carries significant health risks like UTIs bladder or kidney infections UTIs causing miscarriages urinary retention and urine backing up to the kidneys.

That soreness and intermittent muscle spasms that you mentioned must have been pretty scary for her to go through, and it must have been even more scarier when her bladder filled up to that point. How did her bladder fill up that much at the customs area? This must have been a very traumatic experience for her and that time in college also must have been very traumatic as well. When that line is crossed in the kind of scenario I thought of, I would absolutely tell a young woman that I am meeting with to go to the toilet immediately. I would not want her to hold it to the point where it is unsafe because her health can be drastically impacted if she does not.

She laughs about both of these experiences now, so I don't know that they were traumatic, although at the time they were obviously stressful.

In the customs line, her bladder filled up because she drank coke on the flight, didn't use the plane toilet before landing, skipped the airport bathroom before getting in the customs line, and only noticed that she had to go really badly when she was far enough in line that it didn't seem worth it to leave. I did offer to stay in line and wait for her to leave and come back, but she was worried that other people would think she was cutting and that she would get in trouble, and as we got closer to the front of the line she just felt committed I guess. We must have been in line for 40 minutes or so before we were finally let through, and then we found bathrooms on the other side. 

At no point was she close to not making it, just VERY over-filled and in some pain. Once she was able to use the bathroom at the other side of customs and realized her bladder was sore and spasming, she was briefly worried she had damaged something, but she felt good as new within a couple hours, and as far as we're aware there haven't been any long term effects. She was much more careful about taking opportunities to relieve herself for a few weeks after that, but it didn't last.

The time in college was funny to her even as it was happening. She was apparently terrified of not making it because she didn't want that to be the first impression she left on new classmates, but she wasn't the only one suffering, and misery loves company. Her roommate attended with her, and also hadn't been able to go at the break (they were sitting together far from the exit closest the women's room, so they both got in line together and both left the line together when the break ended before they got near the front), and they were apparently complaining in line together the second time about how awful it had been that they weren't permitted a longer break, that there weren't more stalls in a bathroom next to such a large lecture hall, etc. 

In real life the roommate told her to go first and she relieved herself uneventfully after no more embarrassment than having to undo her belt while waiting in line, but sometimes we think up fictionalized versions of this event wherein things go off the rail: the roommate selfishly rushes into a stall and my girlfriend is forced to wait outside as yet another woman gets relief before her, the other stalls have plumbing issues, sometimes there is even a third session she needs to go back to where she squirms around while her now empty-bladdered roommate sits next to her and teases her. Nothing realistic mind you, but we have fun with it.

Sharp stabing pains are never good especially in the kidneys. That is a sign to stop for a yone

My understanding is men and woman react to full bladder sex differently

Some women .my ex included, enjoyed it. Reportedly because their bladder presses on their g spot making it more prominent and causes greater arousal.

Obviously I have no such part and I find a full bladder distracting especially if there is pressure from pee in my penis. I personally dont enjoy it.

My pleasure came from my ex describing how badly she had to pee and her struggle to hold it in . The best part was hoping she would pee on my dick. This happened once.

I would not want her or any woman to actually be suffering in serious pain.

I am interested in hearing how others especially women feel about this.

Yes I agree, I don't wish actually pain and misery on anyone outside the realm of fiction. The experiences I like the most are the ones where my girlfriend is able to enjoy it too.
