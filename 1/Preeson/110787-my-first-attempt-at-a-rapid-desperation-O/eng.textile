My first attempt at a rapid desperation

I started the preparation phase at 8:00, drinking 350ml every hour 🚰😮‍💨 and peeing whenever I felt the slightest need to for it to hopefully weaken my bladder 🤫 for the hold, which I chose to start after my meal 🍴

Not so long after at 9:00, my pee was close to transparent, by 10:00, my pee was fully transparent and I peed every 20 mins 😁

By 11:00, my kidneys reached their maximum speed to which I had to adapt by peeing every 10 mins, even sometimes down to 5 mins

After finishing my meal at 13:00 😋, I decided to go into the 2nd phase, which is to drink 350ml every 15 mins for 1 hour

I was thirsty from then on 😛, which made it easier to drink the required amounts through the rest of the hold

At 14:00, I chugged another 350ml 🚰😮‍💨 and the hold started

I already felt a need to go at 14:05 (4/10) ‼️, and by 14:10, my need quickly increased to a 6/10 😌

At 14:14, I laid on my bed to try to lesser the need, which was a 7/10 ☺️

My need quickly rose up to an 8/10 by 14:22 😖, I held my crotch 🫣 and decided to get out of the bed to note this on my laptop but as I let my hand off of my crotch to type this, I had big leak of about 200ml , the puddle was large and transparent, my feet were soaked 🦶🦶 and I was sliding in that puddle 🤪, this was my first unvoluntary leak, and the biggest one too .

But losing to a leak isn't fun so I decided to continue the hold and concentrate more this time around , starting fresh with a need of 5/10 🙂

At 14:26, I realised that I forgot to drink the 14:15 bottle, so I did 🫡, followed by another one at 14:30 🚰😮‍💨, my need was at a 6/10, almost 7 😄

My need reached 8/10 😊 at 14:37, it was very hard to note what was happening, but no leak this time around 😇, so I kept going

By 14:41, I started holding my crotch again 🫣

4 mins later, I was barely able to drink another bottle 🚰😮‍💨, my right hand which was holding my crotch was severely weakened 🤕 and my bladder was the biggest it's ever been

At 14:54, a strong wave of desperation hit me, a 9/10 , I had a hard time breathing and succesfuly pushed back the painful wave

I drank another bottle at 15:00 🚰😮‍💨

Another strong wave came at 15:02 😳, it was a bit easier than the earlier one, I managed to beat it but it was difficult

And just 6 mins later, another wave hit me 🥲, I was able to hold but I leaked a tiny bit, around a 5 ml drop

At 15:12, just 4 minutes later, another wave, the strongest one came to hit me 🫠, during the difficult hold I decided to stop as I felt that my pee would go up my right kidney, and I didn't want to end up like abraham simpson here : https://youtu.be/0HM2_vQSQPU?si=BRmQMpWhSR9LxS3S&t=42

😬

I lost and flooded my trunks

I had to pee multiple times to fully void , I lost count of how many times 😅

As of writing this (18:15), I still pee very frequently 🤭

I held 50 min from 14:22, and if I count the 10 mins it took me to get to a 5/10, that's 1 hour

Those 72 minutes were very challenging and enjoyable
