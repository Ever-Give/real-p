So yesterday, I was on the Omo Discord server and I met a fellow non-binary person who has been inactive for a while and stopped by in the Omo chat to state that they really needed to pee and would like someone to challenge their holding session. So I DM'd them, we told each other our names, ages, and gender identities and I had them until they had to go to bed~

They were wearing a cute long black button-up skirt while they were holding. I asked how badly they needed to go to which they replied that they were shifting around in their seat and holding themselves occasionally. I then told them to do 10 squats which made it harder for them to hold. Omgg I loved it when they told me the desperate state they were in, it's so freaking cute... and extremely hot~ >//<

I'd tell them to stretch their legs without holding, drink large amounts of water, and other challenges that would make it hard for them to hold until they finally leaked into their underwear when I told them to hold over a toilet >/////<

God, they got me so flustered! (They even teased me by joking how their towel got wet, not with pee but with water, and said "bet you were excited" God they make me blush >//<) They seemed really into me controlling them and I was really into it as well, very excited and really horny during the entire session! >////<

I told them to drink one more glass of water and wait for the remaining time which they spurted some more pee into their underwear.

After that, they got changed and finished in the shower, totally soaking an old pair of jeans of theirs as they said "Ahhh~"

I wish I was there in person to experience everything >.<

They have really pleased me and sent me the smirk emoji after I said that them pissing themselves filled me with pleasure... That made me so unbelievably horny... >///<

Can't wait to have more sessions! :3

(Also this is my first actual passage-long post; I'm not the best writer, so forgive if some of the wording seems off, hehe~)
