I’m not actually an alcoholic Though I’ve definitely had periods of “alcoholism” in my life, where I’d drink every night, I haven’t lived that way in years. Last time I had a drink with friends, three beers got me absolutely sloshed. My limit used to be seven!

Anyway, I do shift work, which can be tough since I’ve been an incurable insomniac my whole life, and this week I’ve had four night shifts in a row, plus training during the day, so I’m fucking exhausted. Absolutely could not sleep after training today, and I only had a window of a few hours before work tonight. So I smoked a joint, knocked back a few shots, and passed the fuck out.

Woke up around midnight to my coworker calling me, asking where the hell I was. I slept through all my alarms! I’ve pissed myself enough in this life to immediately know I’d wet the bed. Dammit! Managed to wash up, douse myself in perfume, and get to work in ten minutes, praying I don’t still smell like piss and vodka. Feel fine now I took some pics before I left; figured someone might be able to beat off to it. Cheers!
