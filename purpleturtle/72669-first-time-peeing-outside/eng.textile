Hey everyone!

I pee outside all the time but from what I've gathered chatting to other people on here, that's not too common. I was wondering, what's the first time people remember peeing outside? Obviously times when you were a child don't count (I think that happened to all of us!)

I think because I grew up in the countryside, I was used to peeing outside frequently from when I was younger and there was never really a phase where I didn't like doing it. There's never been a phase where I haven't been comfortable popping a squat behind a tree if I need to :D Just curious if others are the same!

That’s really cool, thanks for sharing! It’s good to know I’m not the only one comfortable with that sort of spontaneous peeing

So did you just stand up and pee (with your underwear out of the way) or squat down? I’d be worried about getting spiked by a plant if I squatted in a field like that!
