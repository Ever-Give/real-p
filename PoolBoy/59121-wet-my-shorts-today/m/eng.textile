Haven't done this in a while.

Due to covid-19 the beaches are off limits, and the thing I like most is wetting my shorts at the beach.

So while I wait for Coronavirus to disappear, why not have some fun? I wore my blue swim trunks and did what I always do when I'm at the beach.

(Sure, it's more thrilling to do on the beach with lots of people around, but I still enjoyed it :)

Thank you Neil, I agree, wetting your shorts is always a fun thing to do, but since I been doing it for so many years I'm looking for ways to make it more exciting.

I think public wetting is the answer, but I feel like the beach is the only place I can do it freely. I'm too scared to do it somewhere else.
